                <h4>Perfection</h4>
                <p>Perfection is a cosmic being within the universe. Perfection is a cosmic being within my reach.
                    Perfection comes no better than a curse. Perfection is when her cheeks turn peach.
                    Perfection is when I lose my words. Perfection is when we merge both worlds.
                    Perfection is when I cannot hide my lies. Perfection is the innocent glisten in her brown eyes.
                    Perfection is the way she walks. Perfection is the way she talks.
                    Perfection is in her. Perfection is with her.
                    She is Perfect. My Pooja is perfect. She is my perfection.

                    <p>J'adore, I truly love those moments when you smile or look at someone with that innocence in your eyes.
                        Those bright brown eyes know how to project the most genuine emotions.
                    That is why everyone feels so warm around you(I usually feel nervous).</p>

                        <p>J'adore, I know you said you are okay with what I said over the phone, I want to believe you
                            but I cannot just take back what I said even though I can tell that the words did not sit well with you.
                            The truth is, as a friend of mine(as you say) you should understand that I can also feel things and like or not I do feel used.
                            Please understand that I feel used because I go out of my way for you, unintentionally. I spend time learning the things that you love. I feel used because I always answer your calls. I feel used because I think
                            about you often. I feel used because I love you. I feel used because I allow myself to be used but only by you.
                        </p>

                        <p>That's why I give you so much freedom(e.g the freedom to choose who I am to you) and the freedom to have your own space.
                            I don't usually ignore you because of my own ego, it's usually because I feel intrusive but most of the time it is 
                            I am scared. I am scared of the things I would do for you. Trust me, I wouldn't spend hours on someone's sketche and days building 
                            a webpage even if they offered to pay me. I wouldn't even spend time to write a letter for them. To be honest, I have 
                            gotten you things throughout the year but I end up just keeping them. Yes, I chicken out sometimes so I doubt I will even have the strength to 
                            give you this letter. Hopefully not, remember when you said "You are so full of self doubt-it is not nice."

                        <p>Pooja, I wish you knew how many of my rules I break daily for you. About the thing I said Pooja. I don't see you as weak or weaker than last year to be exact. 
                            I guess I just try to convince myself of these horrible things just so that you appear less attractive to me. 
                            It sounds greedy but I perceive myself through you. I have grown weaker and often times I feel like I am letting you down but I am not good at admitting and/or acceptance 
                            so I unintentionally bring you down with me. Ms. Januk, I am sorry.

                        <p>I am learning Pooja. Learning to accept things. It took a year and few months that i have known you for me to accept that I care about you. 
                            For a guy like me, accepting how you feel for someone does not come easy. That's why I do not let myself get too close to you. 
                            I try hard not to trust you because I will jump and break more of my boundaries and maybe lose myself trying to please you. Especially 
                            since you never asked for it. So I choose to back away. I saw it as futile and that my efforts would be in vain especially since I wasn't 
                            planning on initiating anything. My broken trust wouldn't let me change myself for what was uncertain.

                        <p>I also knew that if I started anything with you last year, your life will not be peaceful. 
                            That's why I am still single, I am teaching myself a lesson so that in the future, if I ever find a person who makes me feel like you do, 
                            I would be in a better place to love and take care of her. So I can be able to trust her and show her how I really feel before it is too late.
                            When it's too late all can do is love and support her from the sidelines while watching her move on with what she feels is love.

                        <p>Pooja you are hawt. As someone once said, "Beautiful women are heaven for the eyes and hell for the soul".
                             When is gets too late, you feel this phrase and it hurts worse than death. Well this is me.

                             To be honest Pooja, alot of people could see this. I know that you knew all of this too. I guess I was the only dumb one for not 
                             admitting/accepting it early
